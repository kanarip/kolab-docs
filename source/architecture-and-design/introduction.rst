Introduction
============

The following functional components make up a groupware environment:

#. An :ref:`and_intro_authentication-and-authorization` database.
#. A :ref:`and_intro_mail-exchanger` for the exchange of messages.
#. A :ref:`and_intro_data-storage-layer`.
#. One or more :ref:`and_intro_storage-layer-access-protocols`.
#. One or more :ref:`and_intro_desktop-clients`.
#. One or more :ref:`and_intro_mobile-clients`.
#. One or more :ref:`and_intro_web-interfaces`.

.. #. Instant Messaging
.. #. Voice and Video (-Conferencing)

Furthermore, a groupware environment offers functionality beyond the exchange of
regular email messages, such as calendaring, maintaining address books, task
management, journaling, and more.

All of this should be secure, scalable and flexible. It must also use Open
Standards for protocols and storage formats to provide the user the freedom to
walk away with their data, respect the privacy of its users, meanwhile protect
organizations' interests.

Welcome to Kolab Groupware!

.. _and_intro_authentication-and-authorization:

Authentication and Authorization
--------------------------------

Kolab Groupware uses LDAP for authentication and authorization of users, while
it also includes user and group membership information.

The use of LDAP allows the structuring of information in such a way that it
enables the delegation of authority over its entries, can prevent users from
accessing certain attributes or entries, and allows the groupware solution to
scale to over several millions of users.

For more information on LDAP integration in Kolab Groupware, please refer to:

* :ref:`and_ldap_389-directory-server`
* :ref:`and_ldap_openldap`

.. _and_intro_mail-exchanger:

Mail Exchanger
--------------

Integrated with the :ref:`and_intro_authentication-and-authorization` database,
the mail exchanger in Kolab Groupware is in charge of exchanging messages
between Kolab Groupware users, mailing lists and distribution groups, third
party groupware environments and the internet.

The mail exchanger component is also responsible for anti-spam and anti-virus
measures, protecting your environment against ill-intended distractions.

Kolab Groupware integrates `Postfix <http://postfix.org>`_ by default, and
provides it with additional security and integrity checks, such as the
:ref:`and_mta_kolab-smtp-access-policy`.

.. _and_intro_data-storage-layer:

Data Storage Layer & Primary Access Protocol
--------------------------------------------

A data storage layer for groupware environments must be fast, efficient,
scalable and secure.

A single system can only scale up as far as its local resources allow it to.
It is therefore a pre-requisite the storage layer can be spread out over
multiple individual systems, while maintaining a transparent access methodology
for users - whom do not know what data is where, and even if they did, tend to
forget about it.

The data storage layer must also be accessible remotely. For this purpose, you
require a well defined, widely implemented network protocol that can deliver
fast synchronization of large amounts of data with its clients, understands the
concepts of folders and folder hierarchies, access control, quota, and can
handle parallel access.

In Kolab Groupware, this data storage layer is the IMAP spool, accessible by any
client software that speaks the IMAP protocol.

Kolab Groupware ships `Cyrus IMAP <http://cyrusimap.org>`_ by default, which,
with its so-called murder topology, provides the aforementioned transparent
access to IMAP spools spread out over multiple individual systems.

This optional murder topology allows users of an environment to share groupware
content amongst themselves, even though the content may reside on different
backend systems.

.. _and_intro_desktop-clients:

Desktop Clients
---------------

Although the Kolab web client is powerful and fast, some users might want to use
native Desktop clients. There is a variety of Desktop clients compatible with the
Kolab Groupware solution. They include:

* The Kolab Client `Kontact <http://kontact.org>`_

    * Available for Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and Apple Mac OS X
    * With full Off-line support
    * Automatic Configuration
    * Thousands of features
    * Mobile edition for touchscreen devices available

* `Thunderbird <http://thunderbird.org>`_ with Lightning

    * Available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X and GNU/Linux

* Apple Address book and Apple Calendar (previously iCal)
* Microsoft Outlook

    * using `Bynari connector <http://www.bynari.com>`_ or in recent versions ActiveSync

* Evolution

.. _and_intro_mobile-clients:

Mobile Clients
---------------

All ActiveSync capable devices can be used to connect to Kolab and retrieve groupware data.
This includes Android and Apple as well as the latest Blackberry devices.

Special security features for mobile clients such as policy enforcement, credential separation
and remote wipe can be implemented with Kolab using ActiveSync.

If for some reason ActiveSync is not supported on the device, the CalDAV and CardDAV
protocols can be used instead as a fall back.


.. _and_intro_storage-layer-access-protocols:

Storage Layer Access Protocols
------------------------------

The following protocols provide access to the groupware data in a Kolab
Groupware environment:

* POP3
* IMAP4
* ActiveSync
* CalDAV
* CardDAV
* WebDAV

.. _and_intro_web-interfaces:

Web Interfaces
--------------

* :ref:`and-kolab_wap_api`
* Hosted Kolab Customer Control Panel
* Kolab Web Client
* Chwala File Management
* Mobile Device Synchronization
