Preparing the System
====================

.. _install-preparing_the_system-partitioning:

Partitioning
------------

When installing the Kolab server, we recommend using LVM when partitioning the
system. The following directories could benefit from being on separate logical
volumes, leaving about 10% of raw disk space in the volume group unallocated:

.. parsed-literal::

    /var/lib/mysql/
    /var/lib/imap/
    /var/spool/imap/

.. NOTE::

    Partition and/or divide into logical volumes, configure the mount points and
    mount the filesystems prior to the installation of packages, as packages may
    deploy files into these directories.

Should you decide to partition only after the packages have already been
installed, or after the deployment has already been used, first mount the
filesystems somewhere else and synchronize the contents from the original
directories over to the new filesystem hierarchy. Please note services should be
stopped before doing so, or only corrupt data will be transfered. Remove the
original contents of the filesystem after having synchronized, then mount the
filesystems under their target mount points.

For large or multi-domain installations, we suggest moving ``/var/lib/imap/``
and ``/var/spool/imap/`` to ``/srv/imap/[$domain/]config/`` and
``/srv/imap/[$domain/]default/`` respectively. In allowing ``/srv/imap/`` to be
one separate partition, backup using LVM snapshots is easier. Note that
``$domain`` in the aforementioned path is optional, and should only be used when
multiple, but separate, isolated IMAP servers are to be started.

.. NOTE::

    When partitions are mounted under the aforementioned directories, they do
    not necessarily have the correct filesystem permissions any longer. The
    following is a list of default permissions.

    .. parsed-literal::

        drwxr-xr-x. 7  mysql mysql 4096 May 11 15:34 /var/lib/mysql/
        drwxr-x---. 20 cyrus mail  4096 May 11 17:04 /var/lib/imap/
        drwx------. 3  cyrus mail  4096 May 11 15:36 /var/spool/imap/

SELinux
-------

Not all components of Kolab Groupware are currently completely compatible with
running under SELinux enforcing the targeted policy.

Please consider configuring SELinux to be permissive. Please let us know what
AVC denials occur so we can work on fixing the issue.

.. WARNING::

    The Kolab Web Administration Panel currently depends on SELinux not
    enforcing the targeted policy.

To view the current mode SELinux operates in, execute the following command::

    # sestatus

To temporarily disable SELinux's enforcement of the targeted policy (without
rebooting the system), issue the following command::

    # setenforce 0

To disable SELinux's enforcement of the targeted policy in a manner persistent
across system restarts, edit ``/etc/selinux/config`` and set SELINUX to
permissive rather than enforcing. Doing so also changes the Mode from ``config
file:`` line in the output of sestatus.

System Firewall
---------------

Kolab Groupware deliberately does not touch any firewall settings, perhaps
wrongly assuming you know best. Before you continue, you should verify your
firewall allows the standard ports used with Kolab Groupware. These ports
include:

+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| Port | Protocol  | Description                              |
+======+===========+==========================================+
| 25   | tcp       | Used to receive emails.                  |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 80   | tcp       | Used for web interfaces.                 |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 110  | tcp       | Used for POP.                            |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 143  | tcp       | Used for IMAP.                           |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 389  | tcp       | Used for LDAP directory services.        |

| 465  | tcp       | Used for secure mail transmission.       |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 587  | tcp       | Used for secure mail submission.         |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 636  | tcp       | Used for secure LDAP directory services. |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 993  | tcp       | Used for secure IMAP.                    |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+
| 995  | tcp       | Used for secure POP.                     |
+------+-----------+------------------------------------------+

Summarizing these changes into /etc/sysconfig/iptables, working off of an
original, default installation of Centos 6, this file would look as follows:

.. parsed-literal::

    -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
    -A FORWARD -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited
    COMMIT

After changing /etc/sysconfig/iptables, execute a service restart::

    # service iptables restart

System Users
------------

*   No user or group with IDs 412, 413 or 414 may exist on the system prior to
    the installation of Kolab.
*   No user or group with the names kolab, kolab-n or kolab-r may exist on the
    system prior to the installation of Kolab.

.. _install-preparing-the-system_hostname-and-fqdn:

The System Hostname and FQDN
----------------------------

The setup procedure of Kolab Groupware also requires that the Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN) for the system resolves back to the system. If the FQDN does
not resolve back to the system itself, the Kolab Groupware server components
will refer to the system by the configured or detected FQDN, but will fail to
communicate with one another.

Should the FQDN of the system (found with hostname -f) be, for example,
``kolab.example.org``, then ``kolab.example.org`` should resolve to the IP
address configured on one of the network interfaces not the loopback interface,
and the IP address configured on said network interface should have a reverse
DNS entry resulting in at least ``kolab.example.org``.

Example Network and DNS Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following lists an example network and DNS configuration for a Kolab
Groupware server.

.. parsed-literal::

    # hostname -f
    kolab.example.org
    # ping -c 1 kolab.example.org
    PING kolab.example.org (192.168.122.40) 56(84) bytes of data.

LXC Containers
--------------

LXC containers ("chroots on steroids") need ``/dev/shm/`` mounted read/write for
user accounts.

The permissions on /dev/shm/ need to be as follows:

.. parsed-literal::

    # ls -ld /dev/shm/
    drwxrwxrwt 2 root root        40 2012-11-20 20:34 shm

To make sure the permissions are correct even after a reboot, make sure
``/etc/fstab`` contains a line similar to the following:

.. parsed-literal::

    none /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec 0 0
