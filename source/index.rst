About Kolab Groupware
=====================

Kolab Groupware is a Free Software groupware solution for Email communications,
Events & Appointments, Contacts and more. It supports *mixed client
environments* because of an *open storage format*, and the use of
well-established, standard protocols such as IMAP and SMTP.

For the full Kolab experience, you need a Kolab server, and one or more Kolab
clients. What makes Kolab a unique groupware solution is its focus on security,
scalability, data ownership (aka privacy) and the use of proven components and
protocols.
